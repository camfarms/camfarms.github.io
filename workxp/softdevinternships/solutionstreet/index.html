<p>Following my Freshman year at Case Western Reserve University, I was hired as an intern for Solution Street, a local software development company. At Solution Street I had the opportunity to work with a team <strong>composed of interns</strong> (except for our team lead) on an <strong>entirely new project</strong>! This presented a unique learning opportunity and taught me so much more about software development beyond the technical details.</p>
<p>As a team, we were tasked with creating a new web-based application for a local catering company &ndash; Smokin' Willy&rsquo;s BBQ! The owner of Smokin' Willy&rsquo;s was having trouble managing an increasing number of orders and came to Solution Street looking for a <strong>business solution</strong>. A deal was struck between the two and a team of 4 interns and 1 part-time employee got to work on an application in exchange for free catering at future company picnics!</p>
<h2 id="meet-the-team">Meet the Team<a href="#meet-the-team" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I worked with 3 other interns at Solution Street named Greg, Mark, and Adam. We were led by a part time employee named <strong>Olga Lorenz</strong> &ndash; she&rsquo;s awesome. The 5 of us all reported to <strong>Arthur Frankel</strong>, a co-founder of Solution Street (and the guy in charge of hiring us).</p>

<p>As a team, we sat down <strong>with the owner</strong> of Smokin' Willy&rsquo;s (William himself!) and worked with him to understand his business practices and what we could do to make <strong>running his business easier</strong>. Olga would lead these meetings, but all of us made suggestions and contributed to the discussion on what we could build for him.</p>
<p>Once we had an idea of how his business worked, we got to work on development. We followed an <strong>Agile</strong> development cycle which consisted of daily scrum meetings and weekly sprint meetings &ndash; which William was present for. We used <strong>Unfuddle</strong> as our ticketing system, and under Olga&rsquo;s guidance we began to build the web application using a <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> back-end and an <strong>HTML/CSS</strong> front end. We often worked together on the same tickets since we were all seated next to each other in the office, and we made code peer reviews a normal practice.</p>
<p>As a developer I worked on a number of different parts of the web application, both front-end and back-end. One of the features I am most proud of is a calendar embedded in the home page of the website. This calendar was dynamic and would automatically be populated with orders as they came in through the website! When clicked on, events could be added to the calendar and existing events could be expanded or modified.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned<a href="#lessons-learned" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Since Solution Street was my first serious software development experience, I learned a ton about the development process and technology. It was my first exposure to an agile development cycle and a full stack framework such as Ruby on Rails. This helped me become a much more technically proficient candidate for future internship positions.</p>
<p>Beyond the technical side of software development, however, I also learned about the business side. Being able to sit down and <strong>talk face-to-face with a client</strong> was an extremely rewarding experience and it greatly expanded my understanding of how software development companies do business. Something that struck me was the <strong>importance of communication</strong> between the developers and the client, and how there can often be a bit of a &ldquo;language barrier&rdquo; between the two. For instance, William was an excellent chef, but he didn&rsquo;t know anything about software; it became our job as representatives of Solution Street to <strong>help him understand the potential of our application</strong>.</p>
<p>The way we did this was by first asking him to explain to us his normal business process for taking and filling orders. This gave us a general picture for what kind of application to make. Then, we asked that he identify the steps in his business process that took the most time and together we discussed how we could build off the current application to <strong>automate those time-consuming steps</strong>. Sitting down and working with a client taught me so much about software development that I had never considered before and encouraged me to view the industry more from the view of the consumer than the producer.</p>

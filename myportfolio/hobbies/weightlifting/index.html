<p>Physical fitness is <strong>extremely</strong> important to me. Without constant exercise, I start to go stir crazy and get super irritable. This was never a problem in high school when I was playing  a variety of sports and had daily practices, but since starting college I needed to find a new outlet. Several of my close friends in high school took up weightlifting and they introduced me to it the summer after my Freshman year &ndash; I quickly took to it and dived in head first after two semesters of restlessness.</p>
<p>Lifting appeals to me greatly because it is very <strong>flexible</strong>. Depending on what else I have going on in my life, I can make lifting as <strong>rigorous or relaxed</strong> as I like. It also has tons of variation, so I&rsquo;ll never get bored with it. If I get tired of certain exercises I&rsquo;ll just write a new split and start working on other stuff!</p>
<p>The <strong>empirical nature</strong> of it also appeals to me &ndash; it is extremely easy to measure and track progress which makes setting goals easy. I joke sometimes that <strong>lifting is like real life Runescape</strong>, but instead of getting experience for a profession you&rsquo;re just getting a higher max score for certain lifts.</p>
<h2 id="diet">Diet<a href="#diet" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I have learned that diet is the most important thing when lifting <em>BY FAR</em>. I would go so far as to say 80% diet : 20 % working out. This is because it doesn&rsquo;t matter what you&rsquo;re doing in the gym &ndash; if you aren&rsquo;t eating right, you won&rsquo;t build muscle. Without fuel, your body simply can&rsquo;t build muscle or replenish itself!</p>
<p>This was a tough lesson for me to learn since I have had a problem with under-eating since I was a kid. It wasn&rsquo;t until I started forcing myself to eat more that I finally started to see rapid progress towards my goals in the gym. It took me a while to figure out how much my body needed, but I now know my body&rsquo;s baseline is ~1670-1700 daily calories to maintain my current weight.</p>
<p>When attempting to gain muscle, you <em>MUST</em> hit your body&rsquo;s baseline calorie count each day. The fact of the matter is, it&rsquo;s impossible to gain <em>ANYTHING &ndash; fat or muscle</em> unless you are eating a caloric surplus. Generally, it is recommended you try to eat a surplus of 500 calories on exercise days if you want to gain ~1 lb per week.</p>
<h2 id="my-current-split">My Current Split<a href="#my-current-split" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>For the 2021 fall semester I have had a lot of time to focus on lifting due to my academic load being relatively light. As a result, I have taken this opportunity to put on as much muscle as possible before I get busy again. This is because it is relatively easy to maintain muscle mass compared to building it (since building muscle requires higher regularity of eating and exercising).</p>
<p>This semester I have had the ambitious goal of exercising 6 days a week, and eating 2200+ calories each day. This dietary part has been by far the more difficult of the two since I have such a bad habit of under eating. However, I have been able to put together weekly meals that help me reach my caloric goal. I have also set numeric goals for my sets in the gym:</p>
<p>Comfortable 5x5 Weight:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bench Press: 185</li>
<li>Squat: 225</li>
<li>Dead Lift: 225</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="split">Split<a href="#split" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strengthen chest and increase bench press weight.
<ul>
<li>5x5 @ 185, 3x2 @ 225</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Build up core strength</li>
<li>Maintain barbell squat and practice technique</li>
</ul>

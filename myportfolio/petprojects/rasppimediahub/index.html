<p>I am a <strong>huge</strong> movie and TV show buff, which means I spend a lot of time with my laptop hooked up to my TV via an HDMI cord. However, constantly having to plug and unplug my laptop into the TV has gotten annoying&hellip; so I created the <strong>Raspberry Pi Media Center</strong>!</p>
<p>It is my hope that this will be able to replace my laptop as a designated streaming box for any and all media I want to access. Fortunately, I have most streaming platforms and can easily rent movies through Amazon. Assuming I can get the Pi up and running, I will never have to worry about forgetting my laptop at home again.</p>
<h2 id="the-parts">The Parts<a href="#the-parts" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Through my research for this project I decided that I would use <a href="https://osmc.tv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OSMC</a>
 and a <strong>Raspberry Pi 4</strong>.</p>
<p>The choice to use OSMC was a relatively simple one. The first benefit of using OSMC is its extremely <strong>easy</strong> installation, and the second is its vibrant and active community supporting it. It is an extremely popular Pi OS, and has established itself in the community of fellow Pi heads. It also does exactly what I want it to do &ndash; it mimics a media center <strong>with its own app installer</strong> and tile interface! However, one drawback, is it&rsquo;s a rather robust Pi OS (which maybe isn&rsquo;t even a bad thing?) which makes it pretty cumbersome and difficult to configure or personalize. But, for my first foray into the realm of the Raspberry Pi I&rsquo;m content to keep my training wheels on &ndash; even if it isn&rsquo;t a super lightweight.</p>
<p>I quickly determined that a <strong>B or B+ model board</strong> would be best due to its ethernet port (a <strong>MUST</strong> in my opinion), HDMI/Micro-HDMI ports, and widespread use amongst people making media hubs. After learning more about the available hardware I was deciding between the Pi 3 and Pi 4 boards. The Pi 4, while being more expensive, outpaces the Pi 3 in almost every benchmark, <em>BUT</em> is extremely hard to find in its <strong>B+ configuration</strong> due to its recent release. Since I haven&rsquo;t used a Pi before and don&rsquo;t know what exactly the demand would be on the hardware, I decided to opt for the safer option and splurged on the Pi 4 B model.</p>
<p>To complement my purchase, I also bought an <strong>SD card</strong> for installing the OS, a micro-HDMI to HDMI adapter, and a cute little plastic case to keep it all safe.</p>

<p>The parts are due to arrive this week, I can&rsquo;t wait!</p>

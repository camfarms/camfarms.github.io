<p>My name is Cameron Farmer, and I would like to tell you a little bit about myself! But before I
do, here are some quick links to my <a href="/CF_Resume_pdf.pdf" title="Resume">resume</a> and unofficial transcript.</p>
<p>I am a soon-to-be graduate of Case Western Reserve of University with a Bachelor&rsquo;s of Science in
Computer Science. My professional interests lie within the realm of Software Development &ndash; I
am a maker, and I desire a future career that enables me to make bigger and better applications.
I also have a keen interest in the field of Artificial Intelligence, and will be seeking an
appropriate Master degree program.</p>
<p>With my graduation approaching, I have been considering my post-graduation options and have come
up with two 5-year goals to give me some direction:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Live in another country</strong> and learn the native language (assuming it&rsquo;s not English)</li>
<li><strong>Earn a Master&rsquo;s degree in AI</strong>, preferably in an international program</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to achieve these goals, I have been applying to both professional and academic
opportunities across the globe in countries such as Israel and Germany. I have also been giving special consideration to international companies in hopes of starting work in the United States before being transferred to a foreign office.</p>
